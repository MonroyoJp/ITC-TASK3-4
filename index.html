                                    Pen displays (the tablet surface is a screen) so you draw directly where you see. <br><br>

                                    Recent models (like those ranked in “best drawing tablets 2025”) emphasize higher resolution, responsive stylus input (pressure sensitivity, tilt, low latency), better color accuracy, built-in shortcut keys/dials, etc.</p>

                                <p class="taskDescription">Our keyboard uses a switch matrix which composes of a grid of intersecting row and column wires.
                                    Each key sits at one intersection, forming an open circuit by default.
                                    When you press a key, it closes the circuit between its row and column, allowing a small electric current to pass.
                                    The keyboard's microcontroller scans all intersections rapidly, then detects the newly closed circuit, and identifies which key was pressed.
                                    It then sends that key's scan code to the computer through USB or Bluetooth.</p>

                        <span class="title">Why a Computer Cannot Function Without Software</span><br><br>
                        A computer may appear to be a powerful and intelligent machine, but
                        without software, it is merely an empty shell of electronic
                        components. Hardware alone—such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse, CPU,
                        and memory—cannot perform any meaningful task unless guided by
                        software. Software serves as the instructional brain that tells the
                        hardware what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. Without software,
                        even the most advanced computer is lifeless and incapable of carrying
                        out the simplest operations.
                        <br><br>
                        To understand this, consider what happens when you press the power
                        button on your computer. The first thing that runs is a small piece of
                        software called the BIOS or firmware. This program checks that all
                        hardware components are working and then loads the operating system,
                        such as Windows, macOS, or Linux. The operating system is itself
                        software—it manages memory, handles input and output devices, organizes
                        files, and allows the user to interact with the system through a
                        graphical interface. Without it, your computer would only display a
                        blank screen because the hardware would have no instructions to follow.
                        <br><br>
                        Software also makes computers useful in everyday life. For instance,
                        when you play a video game, the game software tells the processor how
                        to generate graphics, calculate movements, and respond to your keyboard
                        or controller inputs. Without the game software, your computer would
                        not know how to display characters, music, or gameplay
                        interactions—it would simply sit idle. Similarly, when you open
                        applications such as Microsoft Word, Spotify, or Photoshop, it is the
                        software that translates your clicks and commands into meaningful
                        actions.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="essay-box right">
                        <p class="essay-text">
                        The keyboard, mouse, and screen only serve as input and output tools;
                        the real coordination happens through software instructions.
                        <br><br>
                        Browsing the web is another good example. When you open Google Chrome
                        or another browser, software code communicates with servers across the
                        internet to retrieve web pages, display images, and process videos. If
                        there were no browser software, the hardware would not know how to
                        interpret internet data or show it in a readable form. Even something
                        as simple as watching a YouTube video requires layers of software: the
                        browser to display it, the operating system to manage it, and various
                        drivers to handle graphics and audio output.
                        <br><br>
                        From a broader perspective, software bridges the gap between human
                        intent and machine operation. Humans think in terms of tasks—writing an
                        essay, editing a photo, or sending a message—while computers operate in
                        binary code. Software translates human commands into machine language
                        that hardware can execute. Without this translator, humans could not
                        communicate with computers effectively.
                        <br><br>
                        In conclusion, a computer without software is like a body without a
                        mind—it has all the parts but no control or purpose. Software gives
                        life, intelligence, and usability to computer hardware. Whether we are
                        playing games, using applications, or browsing the web, every function
                        we perform on a computer depends entirely on software guiding the
                        hardware. Without it, computers would remain silent boxes of circuits,
                        unable to serve the vital roles they play in our daily lives.

                        The aspects of computer hardware that interest me the most are the
                        <b>processor (CPU)</b>, <b>graphics card (GPU)</b>, and
                        <b>memory (RAM)</b> because they directly influence how efficiently a
                        computer performs everyday tasks. The CPU fascinates me because it
                        acts as the <em>brain</em> of the system, interpreting and executing
                        instructions at incredible speeds. The GPU, on the other hand, is
                        exciting for its ability to render complex visuals in games and
                        creative software, making digital worlds and animations feel lifelike.
                        I also find RAM important because it determines how smoothly a
                        computer can handle multiple programs at once without slowing down.

                        These components work together to shape a user’s experience—whether
                        it’s gaming, editing videos, browsing the web, or studying. A powerful
                        CPU ensures responsiveness, a capable GPU enhances visuals, and
                        sufficient RAM prevents lag. Understanding how they interact has made
                        me appreciate how hardware improvements continuously push the limits
                        of what computers can do in everyday life.
